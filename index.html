            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Justin and I currently live in Dallas, Texas. I currently live with my toy australian sheperd, Mochi. I love to play video games, play pickleball, workout, and go travel (when i have the chance). I have a little coding background (C++) when going to the University of Texas at UTD. I decided that
                nursing was not going to work out for me, so I decided on switching career paths. I also have started another coding bootcamp called #100Devs, which gave me a clear understanding of how HTML, CSS, and Javascript works. I like to eat sushi, korean bbq, and steak.

            <h2>Why I want to become a Software Engineer</h2>
            <p>
                I want to become a Software Engineer because I have a passion with being up to date with the latest technology in the world and have a background of solving complex problems. I would like to work remotely in the future so that I can enjoy my work-life balance. One thing in particular
                that caught my attention was when I was able to program a toy car using code commands on the tablet that was provided by the building to run through an obstacle course going from point A to point B. I was watching other people trying to attempt this little puzzle, but had no luck in solving the problem.
                When it was my chance to go, I ran through so many errors on how to get the car started. But after trying, and not giving up. I finally found the command to make the car move. After making the car move, I had to program the car to turn, move forward, and reverse. It was a very tedious task, but a very rewarding
                end when I was able to get the car from destination A to destination B.
